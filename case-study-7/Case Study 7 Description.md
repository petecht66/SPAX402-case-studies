The first part of this case study asked students to use Microsoft Power Query to pull data from ESPN regarding college football FPI data for the 2025 season. The instructions sheet contains the steps that students had to follow in Excel and Power Query. Essentially, two tables needed to be merged using a common field in order to have just one table detailing the 136 FBS football teams so far this season.

The second part of the case study asked students to start a research project based on the statistical, mathematical, and data analysis techniques that we have covered in class so far. For my project, I wanted to look at how variability in pass coverage schemes related to NFL pass defense outcomes for each of the 32 teams. Using Power Query, I pulled data detailing the usage of the different types of pass coverage schemes for each NFL team so far in the 2025 NFL season. As identified in the Case Study Report, I will have to acquire even more data for this project.

Below are the questions asked about the second part of the case study, which is the research project. My answers to these questions can be found on the same .pdf, which is titled 'SPAX402 Case Study 7.pdf' in this folder.

Research Project Questions
1. What questions are you thinking about trying to answer or decisions are you trying to make through your analysis?
2. What data do you think could be relevant to your project?
3. Who would you want to talk to who could help inform your process?
4. What steps will you take in order to identify relevant data?
