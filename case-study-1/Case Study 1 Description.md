The first part of this case study was to look at a sample of NBA players and analyze their FG% by position. Excel features used for this part include histograms and built-in functions to calculate averages, counts, standard deviation, mean, median, and coefficient of variation. Additionally, skewness and modality are determined for the complete data set of all players.

The second part of the case study was to look at the full population of NFL plays that occurred on 3rd and 2 and 4th and 2 during the 2024 season. With this data set, the 'COUNTIFS' function was used to find the total number of attempts, first down conversion success rate, run%, and pass% for each NFL team. Additionally, the standardized entropy was calculated for each team to measure the true variability of run/pass playcalling in the 3rd/4th and 2 scenario. A scatter plot is included for the simple linear regression relationship between standardized entropy and first down conversion rate.

Below are the questions asked about both of the two Excel spreadsheets. My answers to these questions can be found on the same .pdf, which is titled 'SPAX402 Case Study 1.pdf' in this folder.

Positional NBA FG% Comparison Questions
1. What's the standard deviation of FG% in the data set? Coefficient of variation?
2. Create a histogram, setting bins to 0.02. Is the data bimodal or unimodal? Is it left-skewed, right-skewed, or symmetric?
3. Which player had the highest FG% relative to their position?
4. How else would you analyze FG% to compare scoring efficiency across different positions?

3rd/4th and 2 in the NFL Questions
1. Using standardized entropy, which NFL team had the most variation in their run/pass play calling on 3rd and 4th and 2 in the NFL in 2024?
2. Which team had the least variation?
3. Create a scatter plot. Do you see a trend between standardized entropy and first down conversion percentage?
4. What other information would you want to look at to determine how important entropy is for success rate?
5. How would you go about assessing the optimal entropy for a given team?
