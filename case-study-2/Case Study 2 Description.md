The first part of this case study was to look at a sample of NFL kickers and to calculate their adjusted FG% and their standard FG% for the 2011 season. The adjusted FG% was calculated using conditional probability: a kicker's accuracy from a given distance range was multiplied by the league-wide probability of attempting a field goal from that range. This is an improvement over actual FG% because it removes punishment for kickers who attempted a lot of long field goals. Additionally, the difference between actual and adjusted FG% was calculated.

The second part of the case study was in reference to Nick Anderson missing four straight free throws in the 1995 NBA Finals. Using the binomial distribution, the probability of Anderson missing four straight free throws was calculated. Of course, an assumption is made here that the four free throws are independent from each other, which is not completely true. In Excel, the exponent method and the BINOM.DIST formula were both used.

The third part looked at six of the best receiving seasons in the history of the NFL from a receiving yards standpoint. For each receiver's season, the league average and standard deviation of season receiving yards was calculated. Next, Z-scores were calculated to see how a receiver's season stacked up relative to their era. Finally, these receivers were ranked by the size of the Z-scores.

For the final report, Kevin Durant's 2010-2011 season was analyzed for his counting stats. For rebounds, assists, points, turnovers, and personal fouls, a 95% confidence interval was created for the true sample mean of the counting stat. Standard errors and coefficients of variation were calculated for each stat. Finally, Z-scores were calculated for target mean values for each counting stat, and the NORM.DIST formula was used to find the probabilities of the target values being achieved.

Below are the questions asked about the four Excel spreadsheets. My answers to these questions can be found on the same .pdf, which is titled 'SPAX402 Case Study 2.pdf' in this folder.

2011 NFL Kickers Conditional Probability Questions
1. Who has the highest FG%?
2. Who has the lowest FG%?
3. Which kickers improved the most in your adjusted FG% category? Why?
4. Who do you believe is the best kicker?
5. What other data do you wish you had?

Nick Anderson Binomial Distribution Free Throws Questions
1. What is the probability Anderson would miss all four free throws in a random four free throw sample?
2. What key assumptions are you making?

NFL Receivers Normal Distribution Questions
1. Which receiver do you think had the best single season?
2. Do you think Z-score tells us more than the raw yardage totals?
3. What other data would you want to have?

Kevin Durant Standard Error Questions
1. How likely is Kevin Durant's "true" average to be at least 30 PPG in 2011-2012?
2. What assumptions are we making?
3. How does changing the sample size affect our standard error?
4. Which statistic is expected to vary the most game to game and season to season? As a GM, how might that inform your decision-making?
