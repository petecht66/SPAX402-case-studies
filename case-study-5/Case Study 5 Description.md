The first part of this case study was to consider two different predictor variables in a simple linear regression model with 2nd half wins for MLB teams. The first variable considered was 1st half wins. The second variable considered was a metric that students needed to calculate on their own. For my calculated field, I created first half run differential through first half runs scored and runs allowed. The purpose of this Excel sheet was to determine which regressor had higher predictive ability of second half wins.

The second part of this case study looked at multiple independent variables in golf in order to predict average golf score. Average drive distance (D), greens in regulation percentage (G), average strokes gained putting (P), and scrambling percentage (S) were included in a multiple linear regression model in Excel. The objective was to determine which of these predictors should be left in the model and which should be discarded. Using the slope coefficients and the standard deviations, the true impacts of the predictors were also calculated.

The third and final part of this case study revisited the relationship between standardized entropy of NFL playcalling and first down rate on 3rd/4th and 2. To start, a simple linear regression was run between these two variables. Then team offensive performance metrics were introduced into the model for a multiple linear regression. This effort identified any potential omitted variable bias in the original model.

Below are the questions asked about each of the three sports. My answers to these questions can be found on the same .pdf, which is titled 'SPAX402 Case Study 5.pdf' in this folder.

Simple Linear Regression for MLB Wins Questions
1. Describe the calculated field metric that you came up with. Did the new regression improve the R-squared?
2. If the R-squared was improved, why do you think it happened?
3. Would you expect your calculated field metric to improve your year-over-year performance predictions compared to using prior year wins?
4. If this improvement is the case, how might this impact your decision-making if you were a General Manager?

Multiple Linear Regression for Golf Score Questions
1. What is the prediction formula for the multiple linear regression you conducted in Excel?
2. If a golfer can improve any aspect of their game by one standard deviation, which would have the biggest (and smallest) impact on their score?

Regression for NFL 3rd/4th and 2 Standardized Entropy Questions
1. Do you believe that there is a correlation between standardized entropy and first down rate from the sample of plays?
2. If team offensive ranks are controlled for in the regression, do you expect a change in the relationship between standardized entropy and first down rate?
3. Based on your results from the multiple linear regression model, which independent variables do you think are worth keeping in a model? Why?
4. How did standardized entropy's p-value change? Why do you think it changed in the way it did?
