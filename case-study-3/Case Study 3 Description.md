The second part of the case study was to revisit the Nick Anderson free throw situation from Case Study 2. The past case study focused on a Frequentist approach to the situation. This case study asked students to create their own Bayesian approach spreadsheet, which includes hypotheses and prior probabilities. My null hypothesis was that Anderson did NOT choke, which means my alternative hypothesis was that he did. My prior probabilities were 85% for the null and 15% for the alt. I estimated 

Below are the questions asked about both of the two Excel spreadsheets. My answers to these questions can be found on the same .pdf, which is titled 'SPAX402 Case Study 3.pdf' in this folder.

Surprising Slugger Questions
1. After Kay's 150th at-bat, she is still batting .300. A senior first baseman, who has historically batted .250, has recovered from her injury. Based solely on batting average, who would you start?
2. How would this decision change if you had a prior probability of 1% that Kay would bat .300? How about if it were 50%?
3. What other information would you look at to make the decision who to start?

Nick Anderson Bayesian Approach Questions
1. Restate the results of the Frequentist approach from the original Nick Anderson Study.
2. Create your own spreadsheet and determine a Bayesian approach to the Nick Anderson free throw problem.
3. How likely is it that Nick Anderson choked, rather than got unlucky?
