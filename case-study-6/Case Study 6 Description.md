The first part of this case study involved a research question: how does a pitcher's fastball velocity generally change throughout a game? The objective was to create a dependent variable in Excel; I chose to find the average fastball velocity at each pitch number during a game. From there, I created a scatter plot with pitch number as the independent variable and average fastball velocity as the dependent variable. Based on the shape of the data, different polynomial regression models were run to check for the strongest fit.

The second part of the case study asked students to consider shuttle time as a function of height and weight. First, scatter plots were created for both relationships individually. Next, height and weight were both included in a multiple linear regression with shuttle time to see how the relationships change. A polynomial model using weight as a predictor was also created, and the predicted values were used to create an adjusted shuttle score.

The third and final part of this case study asked students to create a multiple linear regression model with usage and minutes played as predictors and total points as the dependent variable. For the second regression, an interaction term between these two variables was considered.  

Below are the questions asked about each of the three parts of the case study. My answers to these questions can be found on the same .pdf, which is titled 'SPAX402 Case Study 6.pdf' in this folder.

Fastball Velocity Regression Questions
1. What should your dependent variable be?
2. What should your independent variable be?
3. From the scatter plot, is the shape of the data linear or nonlinear? If a polynomial regression fits best, how many turns does it look like the data takes? Can you explain in the real world sense why this might be?
4. How do you interpret the p-value and R-squared from the models you created? Which model is the best?

Shuttle Time Regression Questions
1. Based on the scatter plots between shuttle time and height and shuttle time and weight, is height or weight more predictive of shuttle time? Are the relationships linear?
2. How does the relationship between height and shuttle time change in the multiple linear regression model? Why? What are we controlling for?
3. From your adjusted shuttle time metric, which athlete ID benefitted the most from having their time adjusted? Why?

NBA Usage and Points Per Game Questions
1. Why would including the interaction term (Usage*Minutes) provide more explanatory than treating Usage and Minutes as separate inputs?
2. Does a one unit increase in USG% have more or less of an impact on points if a player's minutes are high?
