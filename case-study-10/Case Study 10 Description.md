The first part of this case study involved Monte Carlo simulations in Microsoft Excel. Using Kevin Durant's 62 game sample in the 2011-2012 season, the goal was to determine the probability of Durant scoring atleast 30 points for a certain number of games in a row. The Monte Carlo simulation with Durant involved running many random trials to estimate the likelihood of his scoring outcomes.

The second part of this case study asked students to create a formal proposal for the course's final project. As mentioned in Case Study 7, I am doing a project on the variability in major defensive pass coverage schemes (Cover 0, Cover 1, Cover 2, etc.) in the NFL. My goal is to determine the relationship that this variability has with a pass defense outcome such as expected points added per dropback. This model will be a multiple linear regression model, as I plan on including control variables such as average defender age, average PFF grade of safeties, average PFF grade of corners, and average PFF grade of pass rushers. I may add more control variables in a future step, as the goal is to isolate the relationship that defensive pass coverage variability has on expected points added per dropback. The rest of the work for this project will be included in a separate repository, most likely titled something like 'SPAX402-final-project' or 'defensive-pass-coverage-variability-impact'.
