The first part of this case study was to make a comparison between the Expected Points Added (EPA) and Win Probability Added (WPA) for the offense during each play of Super Bowl LI between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots. Z-scores were calculated for each value of EPA and WPA in order to standardize these values among the full sample of plays run by the offenses. Scatter plots were created in order to find the relationship between EPA and WPA for these plays. Finally, the differences in z-scores were calculated for each play in order to find plays where EPA and WPA differ.

Parts 2 and 3 of this case study asked students to find an efficiency statistic and a probabilistic statistic within the professional sports world. These two statistics were part of a lesson module about counting, efficiency, descriptive, probabilistic, predictive, and weighted statistics. The point of this lesson module was to identify that each statistic serves a purpose in professional sports. Counting stats show accumulation of numbers, while efficiency statistics standardize the counting stats through a common atomic unit of data. Weighted efficiency statistics apply weights to account for variance in outcomes. Descriptive statistics summarize past performance, while probabilistic statistics describe contributions in terms of likelihood. Finally, predictive statistics calculate likelihoods in order to be more predictive of future outcomes.

Below are the questions asked about each of the three topics. My answers to these questions can be found on the same .pdf, which is titled 'SPAX402 Case Study 4.pdf' in this folder.

Super Bowl LI Probabilistic Statistics Questions
1. Create a scatter plot from Super Bowl LI which displays EPA on the x-axis and WPA on the y-axis. Are they correlated?
2. Calculate the z-score for each play's EPA and WPA, and then find the discrepancy between them. Which plays have the largest discrepancy between the z-scores? Why?

Descriptive Statistics in Sports Questions
1. Find a counting and efficiency statistic that tell two different stories in a given sport.
2. Identify an athlete within the sport that has two different narratives about them based on the counting and efficiency statistics.
3. Which one do you believe to be true? Why?

Probabilistic Statistics in Sports Questions
1. Identify a probabilistic statistic from a sport.
2. What are its inputs and outputs? What do you like about it? Is there anything you think can be improved?
3. Find a team or athlete that grades more highly by the probabilistic statistic than a traditional descriptive statistic. Why do they grade more highly? What is your takeaway?
