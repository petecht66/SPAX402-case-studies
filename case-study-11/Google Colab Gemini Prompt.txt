pff_FIRST_DOWN_GAINED is the target variable.

1 indicates a successful first down. 0 indicates unsuccessful. My goal is to understand the factors that influence whether a play results in a first down or not.

Create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of two to predict the target variable. Conduct a train/test split of 80/20.

Many of the features are categorical and will need to be transformed, so one-hot encode those fields. 

Display a labeled confusion matrix of my test data to evaluate performance. Optimize for accuracy. Show a confusion matrix with totals and another with percentages.

Visualize the tree when finished.
