This repository contains the full collection of case studies completed for SPAX402: Predictive Analysis with Athletics Data, a Sports Analytics course taught at the University of Delaware. The professor for this course, Professor Jack Davis, is currently the Associate Athletic Director of Business Intelligence, Analytics, and Strategy at the University of Delaware Athletic Department. A key objective of this course is to prepare students for a career in professional or collegiate athletics.

Each case study asks students to take statistical and mathematical concepts and apply them to professional and/or collegiate athletics. Every case study assignment is included as its own folder within this repository. Each folder contains the completed work for that case study assignment, which could be Excel spreadsheets, R scripts, Python scripts, PowerPoint presentations, etc. Each folder contains a .pdf that answers the accompanying questions from Professor Davis. Additionally, each case study contains a .md file that explains the assignment in further detail.
