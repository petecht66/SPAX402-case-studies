This case study asked students to locate and discuss a logical fallacy in professional sports. For my one-page narrative, I decided to look at potential recency bias in contract negotations within professional sports. I was curious about the trend of sports teams extending players after just one strong season. I argued that these professional sports executives may be weighing that one good season a little bit too much. Case studies from hockey and football are included in the one-pager.
